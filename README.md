# UE_DL_UL_Session_Vol_Characterization

* In this ad-hoc study, roughly half-million records of device data transactions were analyzed to gain insight into the statistical characteristics and probabilistic distributions of the "volume of data in bytes" that gets delivered per session on both the downlink and the uplink direction 

* The objective was mainly to come up with a data-driven decision on how to set a threshold to be used to trigger 5G NR addition and start splitting the data flow between 4GLTE and 5G NR which have major implications on the latency experienced with small (Lite) data transactions, connection reliability, volume of control messages exchanged with the core, spectrum efficiency, phone power consumption and other KPIs
